# Context Analysis Service Implementation

## Overview

The Context Analysis Service has been successfully implemented as task 8 from the AI Interview Assistant specification. This service provides comprehensive question classification, user profile analysis, job description parsing, conversation history management, and context data aggregation for intelligent response generation.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Core Service (`ContextAnalysisService`)
- Main orchestration service that coordinates all context analysis functionality
- Provides unified API for question classification, user profile analysis, and context aggregation
- Handles error management and logging across all operations

### 2. Question Classification Service (`QuestionClassificationService`)
- **NLP-based question detection**: Uses pattern matching and keyword analysis to classify questions
- **Question type classification**: Categorizes questions as technical, behavioral, situational, or cultural
- **Difficulty assessment**: Determines question difficulty (junior, mid, senior) based on complexity and job context
- **STAR method detection**: Identifies when questions require structured STAR responses
- **Confidence scoring**: Provides confidence levels for classification accuracy

### 3. User Profile Analysis Service (`UserProfileAnalysisService`)
- **Profile analysis**: Extracts and analyzes user experience, skills, and preferences
- **Skill extraction**: Automatically extracts technical and soft skills from experience data
- **Seniority calculation**: Determines user seniority level based on experience history
- **Skill enhancement**: Merges explicitly defined skills with extracted skills from experience

### 4. Job Description Parsing Service (`JobDescriptionParsingService`)
- **Job context extraction**: Parses job descriptions to extract title, company, requirements, etc.
- **Requirement matching**: Matches job requirements with user skills and experience
- **Industry classification**: Identifies industry and company type from job descriptions
- **Technology extraction**: Identifies required technologies and frameworks
- **Gap analysis**: Identifies skill gaps between user profile and job requirements

### 5. Conversation History Service (`ConversationHistoryService`)
- **Interaction tracking**: Stores and manages conversation history with question classifications
- **Context analysis**: Provides conversation flow analysis and interview phase detection
- **Similar question detection**: Finds similar questions from user's historical interactions
- **Statistics generation**: Calculates conversation metrics and user satisfaction scores

### 6. Context Data Aggregation Service (`ContextDataAggregationService`)
- **Comprehensive context building**: Aggregates all relevant context for response generation
- **Experience relevance scoring**: Identifies most relevant experiences for current questions
- **Response approach generation**: Suggests optimal response structure and tone
- **Contextual factor analysis**: Identifies factors that should influence response generation

## API Endpoints

The service exposes the following REST endpoints:

- `POST /context-analysis/classify-question` - Classify question type and difficulty
- `GET /context-analysis/user-profile/:userId` - Analyze user profile and extract skills
- `POST /context-analysis/extract-job-context` - Extract context from job descriptions
- `POST /context-analysis/match-requirements` - Match job requirements with user profile
- `POST /context-analysis/conversation-history` - Update conversation history
- `GET /context-analysis/conversation-history/:sessionId` - Get conversation history
- `POST /context-analysis/relevant-context` - Get comprehensive context for response generation
- `POST /context-analysis/analyze-question-context` - Analyze question in full context
- `GET /context-analysis/conversation-stats/:sessionId` - Get conversation statistics
- `GET /context-analysis/conversation-context/:sessionId` - Get conversation flow context
- `GET /context-analysis/similar-questions/:userId` - Find similar questions from history
- `GET /context-analysis/recent-question-types/:sessionId` - Get recent question type patterns

## Key Features Implemented

### Question Classification System
- **Pattern-based classification**: Uses regex patterns to identify question types
- **Context-aware analysis**: Considers job context and conversation history
- **Multi-category support**: Handles technical, behavioral, situational, and cultural questions
- **Subcategory detection**: Provides detailed categorization (e.g., frontend, backend, leadership)

### User Profile Intelligence
- **Automatic skill extraction**: Extracts skills from job descriptions and achievements
- **Experience relevance scoring**: Ranks experiences by relevance to current context
- **Seniority assessment**: Calculates career level based on experience duration and roles
- **Technology mapping**: Maps experience technologies to standardized skill categories

### Job Context Analysis
- **Intelligent parsing**: Extracts structured data from unstructured job descriptions
- **Requirement analysis**: Identifies and categorizes job requirements
- **Company culture detection**: Identifies company values and culture indicators
- **Technology stack identification**: Extracts required technologies and frameworks

### Conversation Intelligence
- **Flow analysis**: Tracks conversation progression and interview phases
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies question patterns and interview strategies
- **Historical context**: Leverages past interactions for better context understanding
- **Performance metrics**: Tracks response quality and user satisfaction

## Database Integration

The service integrates with the existing Prisma database schema:
- Uses existing `User`, `UserProfile`, `InterviewSession`, and `Interaction` models
- Stores conversation history and question classifications
- Maintains session metrics and analytics data

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling includes:
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Fallback responses for classification failures
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages for API consumers

## Testing

Complete unit test suite covering:
- Question classification accuracy
- User profile analysis functionality
- Job description parsing capabilities
- Conversation history management
- Error handling scenarios
- Integration between services

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 3.1**: Question detection and classification system
- **Requirement 3.3**: Question type classification (technical, behavioral, situational, cultural)
- **Requirement 3.4**: Context tracking and conversation history management
- **Requirement 4.2**: User profile analysis and skill extraction
- **Requirement 4.6**: Job description parsing and requirement matching

## Integration Points

The Context Analysis Service is designed to integrate with:
- **Transcription Service**: Receives transcribed questions for classification
- **Response Generation Service**: Provides context data for intelligent response generation
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Real-time context updates during interview sessions
- **User Management**: Accesses user profiles and preferences
- **Interview Session Management**: Tracks conversation history per session

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Implements intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Async processing**: Uses asynchronous operations for better performance
- **Database optimization**: Efficient queries with proper indexing
- **Memory management**: Optimized data structures for large conversation histories

## Future Enhancements

The service architecture supports future enhancements:
